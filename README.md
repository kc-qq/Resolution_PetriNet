# Resolution_PetriNet
A novel inference approach is presented based on knowledge Petri nets and resolution rules.
Example of the wumpus world based on Python. 
The method all-resolution() computes resolution pairs and their control places, while perform() demonstrates the exploration of the agent. 
A video of a 10*10 room experiment is provided.
