# Resolution_PetriNet
A novel inference approach is presented based on knowledge Petri nets and resolution rules.
Examples of the wumpus world are developed in Python. 
The method all_resolution() computes all resolution pairs and their control places, while perform() demonstrates the exploration of an agent. 
A video of a 10*10 room experiment is provided.
